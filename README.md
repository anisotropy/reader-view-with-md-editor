# Reader Mode View with Markdown Editor

Get rid of annoying ads or pop-ups on a webpage and read it on **reader mode** like [Reader View Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-view/ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh). But you can **compare** the reader mode version and the original one, and edit it in **markdown** format, if you think too many things are removed.

1. Click Webpage button and put a webpage address or HTML code.
2. Click a line in Markdown Editor, and add, remove or edit the line.
